About this project, what was special is that I had to insert a rounded profile picture in 
the middle of a grid-container.
So, I created a grid-container of 1 column and many rows.
Another tricky thing I found with this project,
is that I had to add multiple background-images which had to be positioned at opposite sides.
The first background-image has to be put in the left top side of the web page and again ,not entirely.
The second one has to be put at the right bottom side of the page.
