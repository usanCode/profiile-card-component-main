About this challenge, for me, what was special was how to put the profile photo at the intersection of two 
different containers or items and at the desired position. And the other thing that I found challenging was 
how to put two different background-images at the desired sizes for each of them and at their proper 
positions.
At first, I put these two background-images in the body selector and I discovered their positions were changing according to how 
the viewport's width changes.
Therefore, I had the idea of implementing a new div container called "frame" in witch I put those two background-images. I set the
height and width of that new div container and the size of these new background-images.

This about buiding a container in the middle of the webpage and to put 2 background images at
opposite sides of the webpage and make it this in order these 2 background-images have their shapes
in case the size of the screen is reduced or expanded or in case we view this webpage in another
device.

About this project, what was special is that I had to insert a rounded profile in 
the middle of grid-container.
So, I created a grid-container of 1 column and many rows.
Another tricky thing I found with this project,
is that I had to add multiple background-images which had to be positioned at opposite sides.
The first background-image has to be put in the left top side of the web page and again ,not entirely.
The second one has to be put at the right bottom side of the page.

I have also discovered  when doing this project how to put elements in the center of the webpage.
I have just added these following statements:

    display: flex;
    justify-content: center;
    align-items:center;
